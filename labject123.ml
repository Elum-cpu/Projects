(*  THING. A Lisp object. This is used by all subsequent modules.

    ENVIRONMENT is an association list that maps STRINGs from SYMBOLs to the
    THINGs that are the SYMBOL's bindings.

    CLOSURE (PARS, BODY, ENV) is a user function created by LAMBDA. PARS is a
    Lisp list of zero or more distinct SYMBOLs, the function's parameters. BODY
    is a Lisp expression, the function's body. ENV is an ENVIRONMENT that holds
    all SYMBOL bindings when the CLOSURE was created. It helps evaluate BODY.

    CONS builds Lisp lists. CONS (A, D) means the cons whose CAR is A and whose
    CDR is D. The Lisp list (E₁ E₂ ... Eⱼ) is represented as a series of nested
    CONSes, like this: CONS (E₁, CONS (E₂ ..., CONS (Eⱼ, NIL) ... )).

    NIL is the empty Lisp list. It also means FALSE. Any Lisp object other than
    NIL means TRUE. The Lisp symbol T is often used to mean TRUE.

    NUMBER K is the integer K.

    PRIMITIVE H is a Lisp function that's built into the evaluator. H is an
    OCaml function (FUN ARGS ENV -> BODY) that takes a Lisp list of arguments
    ARGS and an environment ENV. It returns the result of the OCaml expression
    BODY.

    SYMBOL S is a symbol whose characters are in the OCaml string S. *)
